### Achievement

I created some LINE tools.  
The tool was used by more than 5000 people a day.  

1. [Created tool on LINE.](https://github.com/EdamAme-x/line-tool-box)
  - I have also created self-bots and peeking tools, ranging from send posts bot to a hijack. (5,000 people used the system daily. Now it has been regulated by the LINE operator :( )
2. [Created tool on PayPay](https://github.com/EdamAme-x/paypay-tel-brute-force)
  - We created a script to retrieve multiple (too many) phone numbers used by PayPay users.
3. [Created tool on Discord](https://github.com/EdamAme-x/discord-nuker-frontend)
  - I developed a script that allows Token management, participation, serialization, and hijacking.
4. [Created lib on PayPay](https://github.com/EdamAme-x/paypay.x.js)
